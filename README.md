firstly you have to create a folder 
in that folder you have to keep both the .py files (realtimevideo.py & simple_facerec)
then you have to make a folder name images inside that folder and keep all the images there only .

for example -
you are making a folder name called PROJECT , then inside that folder you have to keep both the .py file and as well as you have to create folder with name images and keep all the images in that folder. So, the project will run currectly.
